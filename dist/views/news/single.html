        <p><i>A few days ago ghostwriter <a href="http://cleverwriting.co.uk/">David Meikle</a>, author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reunited-Desert-Risked-Everything-Children/dp/1844546063">Reunited in the Desert</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Last-Gangster-Final-Confession/dp/1780891369">The Last Gangster: My Final Confession</a></em>, and other books, offered to sit down with Scribophile members and hold a <a href="http://www.scribophile.com/forums/publishing/42280/">Q and A session about working as a ghostwriter</a>. Here are his replies to your questions:</i></p>
        <p><strong><a href="http://www.scribophile.com/authors/teri-cross-chetwood/">Teri Cross Chetwood</a>: Does the ghostwriting you do become the property of the person you ghostwrite for? If so, does any copyright ever revert back to you?</strong></p>
        <p>In my experience the copyright is owned by the ‘main’ author. For example with Charlie Richardson, the Last Gangster, I am mentioned in the acknowledgements, and there is a short chapter about how I compiled the book. Charlie died, and so his family retains the copyright. I have found that this is normally the case. However, with Reunited in the Desert, because I was billed as co-author, I share the copyright. Helle Amin, the other co-author, is named beside me in the book. The copyright of my recent books will never revert back to me. If I am proud of a poem or other work I obtain copyright separately, although I am not sure how that would stand up in court!</p>

        <p><strong><a href="http://www.scribophile.com/authors/kirk-borough/">Kirk Borough</a>: Did someone approach you to ghostwrite at first? Did you offer your services to a writer? Or did you ‘apply’ for the job?</strong></p>
        <p>My first book was <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reunited-Desert-Risked-Everything-Children/dp/1844546063">Reunited in the Desert</a></em> in 2007. The circumstances were unusual, to say the least. I was playing tennis against a friend, who had brought his girlfriend along. Steve told me she had an amazing story to tell; I worked for a TV company as a journalist at the time, and asked about her circumstances. Helle Amin told me that her four children had been abducted to Saudi Arabia and she was determined to get them back. Well, she couldn’t even get into the country, far less see the children, and I could see that her situation was quite hopeless. Somehow she obtained a visa, managed to track her children down and won them back. She had to appear in a Saudi court.</p>
        <p>I approached three publishers; two sent me rejection letters, but the third took the project on. I had to make sure that I really ‘sold’ the book with the synopsis. ITV also covered Helle’s quest to have her children returned, and the book was <a href="http://www.wook.pt/ficha/reencontro-no-deserto/a/id/219229">translated into several languages</a>.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="http://www.scribophile.com/authors/dahlia-silverman/">Dahlia Silverman</a>: How free are you to decide on how to develop a story or choose a narrator ‘voice’?</strong></p>
        <p><strong><a href="http://www.scribophile.com/authors/elizabeth-carlton/">Elizabeth Carlton</a>: How do you set aside your own voice, and embrace the voice of the client?</strong></p>
        <p>Good questions. Yes, you have to get it right. You can’t use the same style for more than one book. The publisher will say if you aren’t ‘catching’ the author’s voice. If you don’t get it right, then the project will fail. I have been free to develop stories and reflect the author’s voice. It was important in all cases to set aside my own voice straight away. For example, with Charlie Richardson, The Last Gangster, I listened carefully to his words and phrases. He said ‘understand?’ after every sentence. Well, I didn’t do that, but I slipped the word in a few times at appropriate places. My own voice might say: ‘This is what happened…’ He might say: ‘What happened was…’ So I tailored the text to fit the author. Of course, I added flair where and when I could, but stuck to his way of speaking. He enjoyed dark humour and so I injected some of that here and there.</p>
        <p>Charlie Richardson was an educated criminal and I tried to reflect the way he remembered the court scene:</p>
